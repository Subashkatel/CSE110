# **Subash Katel**

Hello, I'm Subash Katel, a incoming Software engineer currently studying computer science at University of California San Diego. My areas of interest include software design and development, artficial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.


> Looking for internship


Some of the coding language i know are:
```
C++
Java
Python
```
Some of thing i would like to work in the field:
- Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning 
- Computer Vision 
- Natural Language Processing
  
  
This is the ordered version of the above list
1. Machine Learning 
2. Artificial Intelligence
3. Computer Vision
4. Natural Language Processing


Within machine learning there are different approaches such as:
- Machine learning 
  - Supervised learning 
    - Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs.
  - Unsupervised learning
    - Unsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs, and find structure in the data, like grouping or clustering of data points.
  

Do you agree with different approcese of machine learing:
- [x] YES
- [ ] NO
